The ipython notebooks in this section are based on the versions of the IMDB data that was attainable by FTP as of mid-July 2017.

Since then, IMDB has changed to distributing this data via Amazon Web Services. I have not yet had an opportunity to update the notebooks. IMDB's license does not allow for redistribution of their data. My apologies for the rotten bits. -DAF 12/31/2017
